# Support

This document explains where and how to get help with my projects. Please read through the following guidelines before contacting me or opening an issue.

## Understanding Support

Support for my open-source projects is provided on a best-effort basis. While I strive to be as responsive as possible, please understand that all support is provided voluntarily and as time allows.

## Documentation

Before asking for help, please check the project's documentation:

- README file in the repository
- Wiki pages (if available)
- Any additional documentation in the `docs/` folder of the repository

These resources often contain answers to common questions and problems.

## Asking Quality Questions

To help me provide the best possible support:

- Search existing issues, discussions, and Stack Overflow posts to see if your question has already been answered.
- Be clear and concise in your questions.
- Provide context, including:
  - The version of the project you're using
  - Your operating system and version
  - Steps to reproduce the issue
  - Any relevant logs or error messages

## Reporting Issues

If you've found a bug or have a feature request:

1. Search the existing issues to make sure it hasn't already been reported.
2. If you don't find an existing issue, open a new one.
3. Use a clear and descriptive title.
4. Include as much relevant information as possible.
5. Add labels to the issue if applicable.

## Getting Help

Here are the recommended channels for seeking support, in order of preference:

1. **GitHub Discussions**: For general questions and discussions about the project(if available)

2. **Issue Tracker**: For confirmed bugs and well-defined feature requests.

3. **Stack Overflow**: For general questions about using the project. Use the tag `[project-name]`.

4. **Email**: For sensitive issues or private inquiries. Send me a mail at [fasakinhenry@gmail.com](mailto:fasakinhenry@gmail.com)
5. **DEV**: you can reach out to me [@fasakinhenry](https://dev.to/fasakinhenry)

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to the project, please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines on how to do so.
