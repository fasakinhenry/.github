# Contributing to My Projects

Thank you for your interest in contributing to my open-source projects! Your contributions, no matter how large or small, are greatly appreciated. This guide will help you contribute effectively to any of my repositories.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before participating.

## Communication Style

1. Always include screenshots for visual changes.
2. Provide detailed descriptions in Pull Requests. Leave nothing ambiguous for the reviewer.
3. Review your own code first. Leave comments noting questions or interesting points for the reviewer.
4. Maintain open communication, whether in issues or pull requests.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Before submitting an issue:

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. If a similar issue exists, add a comment instead of opening a new one.

When submitting a new issue:

1. Use a clear, descriptive title.
2. Provide a detailed description.
3. Include steps to reproduce if applicable.
4. Mention your environment (OS, browser, etc.) if relevant.

### Suggesting Enhancements

When suggesting an enhancement:

1. Clearly describe the feature or improvement.
2. Explain its benefits.
3. Provide usage examples if possible.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main` (or the default branch).
2. Name your branch descriptively (e.g., `add-new-feature` or `fix-bug-123`).
3. Add tests for new code.
4. Update documentation if necessary.
5. Ensure all tests pass and address any lint warnings.
6. Make sure your code adheres to the existing style.
7. Provide a clear title and description for your PR.
8. Link your PR to an existing issue if applicable.

#### PR Title Convention

Use conventional commit syntax for PR titles:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding or modifying tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

Example: `feat: Add support for dark mode`

### Work in Progress

Use GitHub's draft pull requests for work-in-progress contributions.

## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and PRs after the first line

### Coding Conventions

- Use consistent indentation
- Choose meaningful variable and function names
- Comment your code where necessary
- Keep functions small and focused
